Diving into SwiftUI with hands-on projects from the [Hacking with iOS - SwiftUI Edition](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui) course.

### Projects Overview

Here's a quick tour of what I've been up to in the course:

1. **WeSplit**: Developed a check-splitting app for those post-dinner calculations.
2. **Guess the Flag**: Created a fun flag-guessing game using stacks, images, and alerts.
3. **Views and Modifiers**: Went in-depth into Swift's rendering system and how it shapes UI.
4. **BetterRest**: Integrated machine learning to craft an app that helps improve sleep.
5. **Word Scramble**: Built a game to rearrange letters, leveraging the power of Lists.
6. **Animation**: Added visual flair to UI with springs, bounces, and other animations.
7. **iExpense**: Designed a second view for this app to track personal expenses.
8. **Moonshot**: Educated users about space history using scroll views and Codable.
9. **Navigation**: Directing users around your app, either programmatically or using explicit input
10. **Cupcake Corner**: Developed an app to handle JSON data exchange over the internet.
11. **Bookworm**: Utilized Core Data for an app that helps track your favorite books.
12. **Core Data**: Delved deeply into the synergy between SwiftUI and Core Data.
13. **Instafilter**: Blended SwiftUI, UIKit, and Core Image in a single application.
14. **Bucket List**: Embedded maps and network calls in this life goals-oriented app.
15. **Accessibility**: Focused on making apps accessible to a broader audience.
16. **Hot Prospects**: Crafted a conference app with tabs and context menus.
17. **Flashzilla**: Used gestures and haptics to create an interactive learning app.
18. **Layout and Geometry**: Explored the nuances of SwiftUI's layout system.
19. **SnowSeeker**: Built an app for ski resorts that works great on iPad.
20. **Drawing**: Used shapes, paths, colors, and more to create custom art for your app
21. **Core Data**: Take an in-depth tour of how SwiftUI and Core Data work together

Each project here is a step in my journey to mastering SwiftUI, combining theory with practical, real-world applications. Feel free to explore and share in the learning experience!

**Note**: Please note that the projects **Views and Modifiers**, **Animation**, **Layout and Geometry**, and **Drawing** are only about concepts so there wont be any screenshoots for it.
