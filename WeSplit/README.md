# Project Description

This is project is about building a check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

In this project we learn about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State and @FocusState property wrappers, how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach.
